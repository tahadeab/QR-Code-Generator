# Task: Build QR Code Generator Tool

## Plan
- [x] Create QR Code Generator page with input, generate, download, and clear functionality
- [x] Update routes to use QRCodeGenerator as homepage
- [x] Run lint validation

## Notes
- QRCodeDataUrl component already exists and supports text-to-QR conversion
- Design uses semantic tokens from index.css (primary, secondary, muted, etc.)
- Simple single-page application, no database needed
- All features implemented: text input, QR generation, PNG download, clear function
- Lint passed successfully with no errors
